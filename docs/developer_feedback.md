# Rss App Developer Feedback

As part of the project, we were asked to describe what we think are upsides and downsides to our app.

Here is what we consider to be downsides:

- Current lack of Rss App MySQL database deployment to Microsoft Azure due to limitations on student subscriptions.
- If anything but an RSS link in the xml format is added in the RSS link field, the app crashes. This is a bug requiring further development.
- The downside of using a CSS framework like Bootstrap is a possible issue with style overwriting. Moreover, switching to a different framework would be time-consuming.
- Lack of typescript provides a risk of errors.
- Lack of user authentication during registration.
- Week password policy.



On the upside:

- Rss App is visually modern, clear, and appealing.
- Navigation through Rss App is intuitive.
- Rss App offers the possibility to register user's own accounts.
- Rss App includes an administrator panel where it is possible to add or delete users and grant users administrator privileges.
- Users can create groups of RSS channels for easier management of their feed.
- The use of the Bootstrap framework in the fontend enables full responsiveness of the Rss App. It also provides a consistent UI across all browsers.
- The use of React, which is an extensive library, enables using predefinded functionalities, which makes frontend development easier and faster. It is possible to use reusable elements. It also helps minimise errors related to security.
